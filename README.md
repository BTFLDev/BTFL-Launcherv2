# BTFL-Launcher

The official launcher for the fan-made Shadow Of The Colossus homage game: Beyond The Forbidden Lands.
This is the second iteration of said launcher, with a rewrite of the codebase.

## Beyond The Forbidden Lands

Beyond the Forbidden Lands is a non-profit fan-made PC remake of Shadow of the Colossus with the
restoration of cut content as a major focus, including the Unused Colossi and removed areas from the
game. The game provides the option of playing as close to the original Shadow of the Colossus as
possible, along with the inclusion of a 'Story Mode', which is set before SOTC.

## The Launcher

The game will be run through this launcher, which will mainly check for the validity of an ISO of the
original game and automatically search for updates. Without an original ISO, the user will not be
able to launch the game's executable.
